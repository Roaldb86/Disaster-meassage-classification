### Installations:

- Flask
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- nltk
- sqlalchemy
- re
- seaborn
- pickle


### Motivation:
This project has been conducted as a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The Students were to build:
- An ETL pipeline to load csv files, transform and clean data and load to a sql database.
- A Machine learning pipeline 
- A web app that puts it all togheter and displays some visualisations for the data and predict categories for new messages

### Summary
THe AirBnB prices with an accuracy of 65%. I belive alot of the remaining variance in the price can be explained by the listings standard which is not a feature in the dataset.


### Files:
The project contains a Jupyter notebook where all the technical sides of the project has been conducted,
A blogpost on Medium --> https://medium.com/@roaldb86/want-to-know-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-airbnb-listing-b1a0361330f5
A folder with the raw data and this readme file.


### How to interact with this project.
I advice to read the blogpost first in order to get an overview and the essential. If you want to replicate or read the technical part of the project you can read through the jupyter notebook and interact with it if you want. The raw data is in the foler called "seattle"
